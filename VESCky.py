'''
The Python code example provided is intended for use with the ROS 2 environment and requires the rclpy package, which isn't available in this current environment. However, this script can serve as a starting point for your project. Here's a brief overview of what the script does:

Initialization: The script creates a ROS 2 Node named motor_controller_node. This node can be used to interact with other parts of your ROS 2 system, such as motor controllers or sensors.

User Input for RPM: The script prompts the user to input the desired RPM, which is then set as the target for the motor controller.

Sine Movement and Differential Lock: The user can choose to enable sine wave-based motor movement or differential locking. This part of the script would need to be fleshed out with the specific implementation details based on your hardware and requirements.

Statistics Display: The script includes placeholders for gathering and displaying various statistics like IMU data, temperature, duty cycle, and regenerative capabilities. These would need to be linked to your actual sensor readings and data sources.

Continuous Operation: The script runs in a loop, continuously updating the motor control and displaying the statistics.

You would need to integrate this script with the specific ROS 2 messages and services that are relevant to your VESC and motor setup. The GitHub repository you mentioned would be a valuable resource for finding the specific ROS 2 topics and services you need to interact with.

To use this script:

Install ROS 2: Ensure that ROS 2 is installed on your system.

Set Up Your Hardware: Connect your VESC and motor to your system and ensure they are configured correctly.

Customize the Script: Modify the script to interact with the specific ROS 2 topics and services used by your hardware.

Run the Script: Execute the script in your ROS 2 environment.

Please ensure that you have the necessary technical knowledge or seek assistance from someone experienced with ROS 2 and Python programming to safely implement and test this script with your hardware. ​​
