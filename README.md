For ROS2 you will need the VESC driver (there is a ROS2 fork) found here:

https://github.com/f1tenth/vesc/tree/ros2

ROS1 this is the main, this will run on ROS 1 noetic (tested by me).

https://github.com/f1tenth/vesc/tree/main

Use Pulldown in the top left to get branches for kinetic & foxy ROS distributions

Start ROS2 with:

`ros2 launch vesc_driver vesc_driver_node.launch.py`

If prompted "permission denied" on the serial port: `sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0`

Once up and running you can input commands like:

`ros2 topic pub /commands/motor/speed std_msgs/msg/Float64 "data: 800.0"`


`ros2 topic pub /ackermann_cmd ackermann_msgs/msg/AckermannDriveStamped "{header: {stamp: now, frame_id: 'some_frame'}, drive: {steering_angle: 0.0, speed: 1.0}}"`

One more with detail:

`ros2 topic pub /ackermann_cmd ackermann_msgs/msg/AckermannDriveStamped "{header: {stamp: now, frame_id: 'some_frame'}, drive: {steering_angle: -180.5, speed: 0.50}}"`

Command Structure:

ros2 topic pub: This is the ROS2 command to publish data to a topic.
/ackermann_cmd: This is the name of the topic you're publishing to.
ackermann_msgs/msg/AckermannDriveStamped: This specifies the message type that you're publishing.
Message Components:

The AckermannDriveStamped message is being populated with data in the YAML format. It has two main parts: header and drive.
Header:

header: This is a standard ROS message header.
stamp: now: This sets the timestamp to the current time. 'now' is a keyword that ROS2 understands as the current time.
frame_id: 'some_frame': The frame_id is a string that indicates the coordinate frame in which the data is expressed. Here, it's set to 'some_frame', which is a placeholder for your specific frame of reference.
Drive:

drive: This is specific to the AckermannDriveStamped message and contains the control commands.
steering_angle: -180.5: This sets the steering angle of the car. The value -180.5 is presumably in degrees, but this value seems unusually high for a steering angle, which usually ranges between -45 to +45 degrees for most vehicles.
speed: 0.50: This sets the speed of the car. The value 0.50 could be in meters per second, kilometers per hour, or another unit of speed, depending on how your system is set up.<hr>


Given the available subscribers, publishers, and services of the `/vesc_driver_node` in ROS 2, there are several interesting Python programs you could write. Here are some example ideas:

1. **Speed Profile Controller**:
   - Write a program that varies the motor speed over time following a predefined profile. For example, you can create a sinusoidal speed pattern, a ramp-up and ramp-down pattern, or a step function pattern.
   - This could be useful for testing motor performance at different speeds or for applications where variable speed control is required.

2. **Position-Based Speed Control**:
   - Develop a program that sets the motor speed based on its position. Use the `/commands/motor/position` to read the motor position and adjust the speed accordingly. This can simulate a scenario where the
   - motor speed needs to change based on the position in a mechanical system.

3. **Brake Testing Program**:
   - Create a script that accelerates the motor to a certain speed and then applies different levels of braking force using the `/commands/motor/brake` topic. This could be useful for testing how the motor
   - and connected mechanical systems respond to braking.

4. **Duty Cycle Variation Program**:
   - Write a program that varies the duty cycle of the motor control signal. This can be useful for understanding how changes in duty cycle affect motor performance and power consumption.

5. **Servo Control with Feedback**:
   - Implement a program to control a servo's position using `/commands/servo/position`. Use the feedback from sensors (like IMU data from `/sensors/imu` or `/sensors/imu/raw`) to adjust the servo position dynamically.
   - This could simulate a balancing system or a feedback-controlled mechanism.

6. **Data Logging and Analysis**:
   - Write a program that subscribes to the `/sensors/core`, `/sensors/imu`, or other sensor topics to log data over time. Then, use this data for analysis or visualization to understand the performance of the motor under
   - different conditions.

7. **Interactive Motor Control Interface**:
   - Develop a script with a simple user interface (could be command-line or GUI-based) that allows the user to manually input commands for speed, position, duty cycle, etc., and observe the motor's response in real-time.

8. **Automated Test Suite**:
   - Create an automated testing suite that runs the motor through a series of tests (speed, position, brake, duty cycle) and records the results. This can be used for routine diagnostics or performance verification.

9. **ROS2 Services Integration**:
   - Utilize the available service servers (like `/vesc_driver_node/set_parameters`) to write a program that changes configuration parameters on the fly and observes the effects of these changes.

Each of these ideas would help in understanding the capabilities of your motor and the VESC driver, and they could be foundational for more complex robotics applications. Remember to handle the motor and connected systems 
safely, especially when experimenting with different control strategies.
